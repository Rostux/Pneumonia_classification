    <string name="pneumonia_description">
        Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it.
        The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli.
        The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.
        The germs that cause pneumonia are contagious. This means they can spread from person to person.
        Both viral and bacterial pneumonia can spread to others through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough.
        You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with
        pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment.
        However, it doesn’t spread from person to person. \nSymptoms of pneumonia:
